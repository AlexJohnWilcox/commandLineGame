This is my first game made in my intro coding class. The game is made with python and can be run in a command line or through any IDE.

Steps to run:

1. Download .py file to downloads
2. In an IDE open the file and hit compile and run
3. If in a terminal and on Linux simply run "python3 program5.py"
4. If on windows you must download Python then run the file
